## Features

### Reactive Forms

The application leverages Angular's ReactiveForms module to create dynamic and reactive form controls. This ensures that the form inputs are synchronized with the application's state, providing real-time feedback and validation.

### Custom Input Form Components

Custom input components are developed to enhance reusability and maintainability across the application. These components encapsulate specific input logic and styles, making it easy to manage and update form fields consistently. These components are from another personal project - https://github.com/rammer17/ng-is

### Observable Streams

Observable streams are used extensively to manage asynchronous data operations and state changes. This allows the application to handle user interactions and data flow efficiently, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
